This OBS Plugin wraps the OBSApi in Python and provides an embedded Python environment for development of custom Python sources.

This allows you to create custom sources using easily editable Python scripts.

Example scripts can be found in the ExampleScripts folder. 

Some documentation is available on the Wiki https://github.com/TheAndyRoid/PythonPlugin/wiki
